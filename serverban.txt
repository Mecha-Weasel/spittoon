//	Updated 2024-02-14 by Weasel (Weasel.SteamID.155@gMail.com)
//
//	This is a CURATED list of FoF game-servers to display on the "highlighted server browser" (HSB).
//	This curated list currently contains 30 known-good server IP addresses.
//	The actual number of servers may be greater, due to having multiple servers hosted on the same IP address.
//
//	To utilize this HSB list, requuires an updated client-side file from the related GitHub:
//		For Windows FoF clients: client.dll
//		For Linux FoF clients: client.so
//	The GitHub is:
//		https://github.com/Mecha-Weasel/spittoon/
//
//	Servers intentionally EXCLUDED from this list typicalling include:
//		Servers that push fake information into the server-list.
//		Servers that run bots - but go out of their way to make them appear do NOT be bots (aka "fake players").
//		The only known offender of this has historically been "FastPath".
//
//	The original/official list as of 2025-02-03 has not been updated in (at least) many, many months.
//	The original/official list as of 2025-02-03 had approximately 43 entries, of which only 13 were still working.
