Project "Spittoon":
==================
Mostly, the purpose of this project is to work-around the fact that the Fistful-of-Frags (FoF) server list is currently populated with stale data.  In the past, the developer (singular) would manually update the server list data - by way of an embedded link to a web-hosted file, that only he controls.

Since the developer has been away from the game for nearly two (2) years now, the current official server list data (effectively a very curated list of dedicated game servers) has gotten VERY stale.  At last check, the server list data included approximately 43 server IP addresses, of which only 13 were still active. Also, various new servers have come online since then, and several existing ones have undergone IP address changes.

This project is not a reflection upon, or judgement of the developer.  Whatever may be the cause for his prolonged absence, I wish him well.  Hopefully he is still alive, I have had no proof-of-life in a long time.  This project is just a way of dealing with the reality that FoF players currently face.  Hopefully, preventing it from effectively becoming "abandon-ware".

This project hosts TWO (2) related efforts, each with its own installer:
1) A client-side modification as a "work-around" to effectively update the server list data.
2) A package of thumbnail previews for many community maps.

NOTE: Windows may display a warning about the installer being an "UNRECOGNIZED Program". This does NOT mean its a virus, trojan or other type of malware. Effectively, this is because free projects like this can not afford costs associated with "code-signing". If it was truly malware, the message would be different - not just "UNRECOGNIZED". You can click "More Info" and then "Run Anyway". Alternatively, see the MANUAL installation instructions.

FoF Community Server List Update (aka HSB Work-Around):
======================================================
The server list update effectively re-directs the FoF game client to use this GitHub as its source for an updated server list - instead of using the stale data posted in the old/official system.  

Ideally, this is an entirely temporary solution.  Should the developer come back to actively maintaining FoF, this work-around will obviously become irrelevant, as he can just update with similar content through the original URL (hopefully making use of the curation work I have done here), and push-out an FoF update through Steam that will roll-back / over-write this customization entirely.  That would, of course, entirely negate the NEED for this work-around (assuming he will be able to stay engaged with the game).

Again, the goal here is not to "usurp control" of the game from the developer.  This is just to "work-around" his (prolonged) absence.

FoF Community Map Thumbnails Update (aka HSB Thumbnails):
========================================================
The HSB thumbnail update adds preview thumbnails for the many community-developed maps to your FoF installation.
