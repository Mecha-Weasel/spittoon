Project "Spittoon" Frequently-Asked-Questions (FAQ):
===================================================

Glossary:
--------
* FoF = Fistful of Frags (the game)
* HSB = Highlighted Server Browser (the graphic interface in FoF showing thumbnails of map running on various FoF game-severs).

[1] Is this required?
--------------------
Q: Can I continue to play FoF without installing either of these "Spittoon" updates?

A: Absolutely.  These are totally optional.  However, you will just have a more LIMITED experience, specifically:
1) Way less servers displayed in the HSB - possibly meaning servers in your region do not get shown at all.
2) Generic "Custom Map" icons shown more often for map that were not part of the last FoF game-update.

[2] Problems playing with others?
--------------------------------
Q: If I load these updates (or do not load these updates) will either cause me problems playing with other who do or do not load them?

A: No.  You and your friends may still play together on the same servers, etc.  However, depending on whether or not you both load them, you may not both see the same list of servers available - instead only seeing a smaller sub-set.

[3] Benefits to using?
---------------------
Q: What is the benefit of loading either of these "Spittoon" updates?

A: Obviously, you didn't read the documention in the GitHub.  See these documentation links:
1) About the project generally ... https://github.com/Mecha-Weasel/spittoon/blob/main/README.md
2) About the HSB work-around specifically ... https://github.com/Mecha-Weasel/spittoon/blob/main/ProjectSpittoon-HSB-WorkAround.md
3) About the HSB thumbnails specifically ... https://github.com/Mecha-Weasel/spittoon/blob/main/ProjectSpittoon-HSB-Thumbnails.md

[4] If/when developer returns?
-----------------------------
Q: What happens if/when the developer returns to being actively engaged with FoF?

A: Hopefully, all this becomes irrelevant.  Nothing done with these updates should interfere with the developer pushing out updates via Steam and negating the need for them.  Players should not be impacted in any way.

[5] Windows Installer warnings?
------------------------------
Q: When I run either of the "Installer" programs, Windows shows are warning about it being an "Unrecognized Program", what is up with that?

A: That is because the progam(s) are not "code-signed", which is common for paid-companies producing commercial software, but out of the scope for free things like this.

[6] Possible to manually install instead?
----------------------------------------
Q: I do not trust the Windows "Installer" programs.  Can I install the content manually instead?

A: Absolutely.  The "Installer" programs are just a convenience.  The instructions for each are included in their documentation in the GitHub, specifically:
1) About the HSB work-around specifically ... https://github.com/Mecha-Weasel/spittoon/blob/main/ProjectSpittoon-HSB-WorkAround.md
2) About the HSB thumbnails specifically ... https://github.com/Mecha-Weasel/spittoon/blob/main/ProjectSpittoon-HSB-Thumbnails.md

[7] Maps don't already include HSB thumbnails?
---------------------------------------------
Q: Why don't the maps already include HSB preview thumbnails for them?

A: Many maps actually pre-date the existance of the entire HSB feature, and many map authors are not aware of how it operates.

[8] Who DF are you?
------------------
Q: Who is this "Weasel" guy, and why is he doing this?

A: I am just a person with a 35+ year technology background that has been playing or involved with FoF from it's pre-Steam versions, and game-servers and map/level design since pre-Y2K.
